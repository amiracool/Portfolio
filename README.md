# Amira Haque | Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This portfolio showcases my journey as a socio-technical developer and the projects Iâ€™ve poured my heart into. From blending social work principles with cutting-edge tech to creating user-focused designs, Iâ€™m on a mission to make a difference, one line of code at a time.

## ðŸŒŸ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Amira! Iâ€™ve taken a curious path to tech, combining my background as a social worker with my love for building things. Iâ€™m currently diving deep into full-stack development, learning tools like JavaScript, React, Python, and SQL. My aim? To craft digital solutions that solve real-world problems with empathy and purpose.

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably grooming dogs (check out [OhRahRah](http://www.ohrahrah.co.uk)), walking Arissa (my cheeky Bichon Frise), or dreaming up ways to combine tech with meaningful impact.

### [OhRahRah](http://www.ohrahrah.co.uk)
